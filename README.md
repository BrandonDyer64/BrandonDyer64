## Brandon Dyer

Hi, I'm Brandon (he/him). I build lots of things here on my GitHub. I'm a professional software engineer with a passion for systems, frontend, and graphics programming.

I work at Disney as a Software Engineer working on their streaming platform in Rust.

I'm a huge fan of Rust and am working towards making it my primary language, both on the frontend and backend. I love SCRUM and Agile development, I speak Epseranto, and I use the Dvorak keyboard layout.
