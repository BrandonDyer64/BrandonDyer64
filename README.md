## Brandon Dyer

Hi, I'm Brandon. I build lots of things here on my GitHub. Some of my latest work is private _for now_, but I'll let everyone know the moment it goes public! I'm a professional software engineer with a passion for systems, frontend, and graphics programming.

I work at [Rural Sourcing](https://ruralsourcing.com) as an Analyst level Engineer working on enterprise Java / Node backends and React / Angular frontends.
